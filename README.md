C# implmentation of GDQuest's ["Make Your First 2D Game with Godot"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk&list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KH_z21S_XeXD3Ht3WnSqW97) which was orignally done in GDScript. Maybe someone finds this useful. There a few features missing which I didn't find interesting but the main building blocks are there.
